## Overview

If you lost points on one of your labs all is not lost! There is a makeup lab that you can take advantage of to improve
your grade. For the makeup lab you can pick **ONE** of your previous labs and resubmit them for a higher grade. The starter code
will be an empty repository. All you need to do is copy all the code from your old lab into the lab repo, fix any issues that
you had and then re-submit!

- [makeup Lab]({% link _lessons/lesson30.md %})

Once you are ready to have your makeup lab graded you **MUST** send an email to your instructor requesting a regrade!

## Guidelines

- **Problem:** You didn't do the assignment. And the late window has passed.
  - **Solution:** Copy your completed lab to the makeup lab and email your instructor.
- **Problem:** Your code did not compile.
  - **Solution:** You need to go to the [Kount Computer Lab (CCP241)](https://cs481.boisestate.edu/ccp-tour/index.html) or
  log in remotely and fix your code so it compiles on the department machines. Once you have your code fixed you can email
  your instructor and ask for a regrade. You may want to attend office hours for additional guidance.
- **Problem:** You did the lab but forgot to push to GitHub üôÅ
  - **Solution:** Copy your completed lab to the makeup lab and email your instructor.

TODO: Give a brief overview of why you are resubmitting the lab. What problem did you fix? How did you verify that you
fixed it?
