## Overview

In this lesson, we will formally introduce several collections that you can use to store all your
data. In previous lessons you have used an `ArrayList` to store data, now we will dig into
other collections that are available. Java has a rich set of collections and it would be
impractical to introduce them all in a one semester course. So we will introduce some core
data-structures that are used to build more complex data-structures.


## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify node based data-structures (Linked List)
- Identify when it is appropriate to use a Linked List
