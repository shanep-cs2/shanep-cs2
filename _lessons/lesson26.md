This checkpoint is pretty simple! All you have to do accept the assignment watch the video that is
linked in the README.md! GitHub timestamps when you accepted the assignment. Watching the video is
on the honor system ðŸ˜Š.

You should get the starter code into a state where it is all compiling so you are ready to hit the
ground running!
