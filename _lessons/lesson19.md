## Overview

In this lesson, we will look at some more complex data structures and identify some situations where
it would be appropriate to use them. Not all collections are created equal so you need to be aware
of when to use one collection over another. For example, if you are modeling ticketing software you
may want to use a Queue because you want first in first out (FIFO) behavior, you wouldn't want the
first person to buy a ticket to actually be the last person to get a ticket which would happen if
you used a stack to model that domain.
