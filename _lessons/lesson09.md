## Overview

Recursion is a way of solving a problem where a solution to the problems depends on solutions to
smaller instances of the same problem. Or to put it simply it is when a method calls itself to
find the answer to a problem! There are a lot of problems in computer science that are naturally
recursive and the resulting algorithms can be quite elegant.
