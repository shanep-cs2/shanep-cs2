## Overview

Recursion is a way of solving a problem where a solution to the problems depends on solutions to
smaller instances of the same problem. Or to put it simply it is when a method calls itself to
find the answer to a problem! There are a lot of problems in computer science that are naturally
recursive and the resulting algorithms can be quite elegant.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand Recursion
- Identify some issues recursion can create
- Create recursive methods
- Use recursion to iterate over node based structures.
