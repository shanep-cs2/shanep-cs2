## Overview

In this lesson, we will explore some basic sorting algorithms. You may find yourself in a situation
where you have a collection of stuff in a data structure in a random order. There are quite a few
instances where you may need to sort your data so it is easy to present to the user. For example you
may have a collection of books and want to display them in alphabetical order so you will sort based
on title.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explore some well known common sorting algorithms
- Identify when to use one algorithm over the other.
