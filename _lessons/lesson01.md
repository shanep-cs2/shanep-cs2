## Task 1 - Review and explore

For this task all you need to do is explore the site. Click through all the links and see if you can
find anything that is missing or broken! You can get extra credit for any typo you find on the
course website. Read all the class policies to make sure you are familiar with what is expected of
you during the semester.

## Task 2 - Install Git

You will also need to install git so it is available on the command line if necessary. Git can be
download from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/). If you are on windows make sure and install the
**64-bit Git for Windows Setup** version. Keep all the setting default unless you **really** know
what your doing.

## Task 3 - Install VSCode

While you are free to use whatever IDE or editor you want the only supported editor is VSCode. You
will need to install the [coding pack for
Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/installers) which will give you all the tools
necessary to complete the labs.
