## Task 1 - Review and explore

For this task all you need to do is explore the site. Click through all the links and see if you can
find anything that is missing or broken! You can get extra credit for any typo you find on the
course website. Read all the class policies to make sure you are familiar with what is expected of
you during the semester.

## Task 2 - Post an Introduction

Go to the class discussion forum and post an introduction with the following information.

**Hint:** The discussion form is linked on the [home page]({% link index.html %})

- Name
- Are you a CS major, minor, or other?
- How long ago did you take CS121 (last semester, last year, etc.)
- Did you run into any issues when installing VSCode or Git?
- (optional) Share one cool fact about yourself :)
