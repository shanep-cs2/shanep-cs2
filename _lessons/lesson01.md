## Overview

{% include youtube.html param="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RphInP_ivN8" %}

For many students this will be the first time you have been exposed to more advanced Object Oriented
(OO) programming concepts. This course has been designed to take someone who has never seen these
concepts before to being able to understand and use them in 1 semester. In order to succeed in the
course, it will be critical for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with the reading,
and lab activities.  Please take the time to review your course schedule for this semester to ensure
you'll be able to dedicate the time necessary to be successful in the course. 

## Task 1 - Review and explore

For this task all you need to do is read the [syllabus]({% link _docs/syllabus.md %}) and 
explore the site. Click through all the links and see if you can find anything that is missing
or broken! You can get extra credit for any typo you find on the course website.

## Task 2 - Install VSCode

While you are free to use whatever IDE or editor you want the only supported editor is VSCode. You
will need to install the [coding pack for
Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/installers) which will give you all the tools
necessary to complete the labs.

## Task 3 - Post an Introduction

Go to the class discussion forum and post an introduction with the following information.

**Hint:** The discussion form is linked on the [home page]({% link index.html %})

- Name
- Are you a CS major, minor, or other?
- How long ago did you take CS121 (last semester, last year, etc.)
- (optional) Share one cool fact about yourself :)
