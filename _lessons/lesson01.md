## Task 1 - Review and explore

For this task all you need to do is explore the site. Click through all the links and see if you can
find anything that is missing or broken! You can get extra credit for any typo you find on the
course website. Read all the class policies to make sure you are familiar with what is expected of
you during the semester. Once you are done with that head over to [lesson02]({% link _lessons/lesson02.md
%}) and get started on the scavenger hunt!
