## Task 1 - Review and explore

For this task all you need to do is explore the site. Click through all the links and see if you can
find anything that is missing or broken! You can get extra credit for any typo you find on the
course website. Read all the class policies to make sure you are familiar with what is expected of
you during the semester. 

## Task 2 - Textbook

We will be using an online textbook for this class, the textbook has integrated homework that you
will need to complete each week. Sign up for the [textbook]({{site.data.semester-info.textbook}})
so you can get started on the first homework.

## Task 3 - Discussion Forum

Participation in the class [discussion forum]({{site.data.semester-info.discussion}}) is mandatory this semester. Your
instructor has already added you to the forum, if you can not access it please email your instructor **ASAP**! Log onto the
forum and respond to any messages posted by your instructor or fellow students.

## Task 3 - First Lab

Once you are done with that head over to [lesson02]({% link _lessons/lesson02.md %}) and get started
on the scavenger hunt!
