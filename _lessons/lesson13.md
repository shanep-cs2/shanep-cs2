## Overview

[Generics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java) were added to the Java programming language in 2004. Generics
allow a developer to write data-structures and algorithms that can be adapted to any type by the compiler. Generics are
a powerful feature that allow you to avoid copying and pasting code. Before Generics a developer had to manually cast
objects to the correct type when using collections. Manually casting your objects is error prone and as you can imagine
leads to a lot of obscure and hard to fix bugs. By adding Generics to the language the compiler can check your code and
automatically generate everything needed on your behalf.
