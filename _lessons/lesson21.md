## Overview

In this lesson, we will explore some basic searching algorithms.  Once you have a collection of
stuff you are going to want to search it for information and sort the information in a particular
order. Not all searching algorithms are created equal. Thus we will also introduce algorithm
analysis and Big-O notation so we can categorize all the different approaches.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand basic algorithm analysis (BigO)
- Explore some well known common searching algorithms
