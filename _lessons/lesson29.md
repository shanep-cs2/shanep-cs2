## Task 1 - Complete the Student Evaluation

Complete the [student evaluations]({{site.data.semester-info.student-evals}}). Once you complete
the evaluation email you instructor and I will add {{page.points}} to your final exam score!

The evaluation should take no more than 5 minutes and your feedback is greatly appreciated!

## Task 2 - Review your work

Time to review for the final exam! The best way to review is to go back through all your old
labs and refresh you memory. Once you have completed that you can study some of the old exams
that are posted for you on [canvas]({{site.data.semester-info.sample-exams}})
